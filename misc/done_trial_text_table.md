check rhythm: T, bad rhythm: F, bad acc: F is impossible; you cant be right with the rhythm but have the notes wrong

when in exam, always check rhythm, but always adv regardless. 
dont show mistakes
always shows animation before, none of post-animation

if not passed => show failed text. its possible that he doesn't have any mistakes, but failed anyway, 
if he didn't play enough notes.
