check rhythm: T, bad rhythm: F, bad acc: T is impossible; you almost certainly cant play wrong notes but get the rhythm right

when in exam, always check rhythm, but always adv regardless. 
dont show mistakes
always shows animation before trial, never show post-trial animation

if not passed => show failed text. its possible that he doesn't have any mistakes, but failed anyway, 
in case he didn't play enough notes.
